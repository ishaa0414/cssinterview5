    <h2>Show implementation of transition.</h2>
    <p>The transition-property specifies the CSS properties to which you want the
        transition effect. Only these CSS properties are animated.</p>
        <div class="transition">Transition box<br>Hover to see transition!</div>

     <h2>Show implementation of transformation.</h2>
     <p>CSS transforms are a collection of functions that allow to shape elements in
particular ways:
<ul>
<li>translate: moves the element along up to 3 axis (x, y and z)</li>
<li>rotate: moves the element around a central point</li>
<li>scale: resizes the element</li>
<li>skew: distorts the element</li>
</ul>
<div class="translate box">Translate</div>
<div class="rotate box">Rotate</div>
<div class="scale box">Scale</div>
<div class="skew box">Skew</div>
</p>
     <h2>Show implementation of grid.</h2>
     <div class="grid">
        <div class="item item-1">1</div>
        <div class="item item-2">2</div>
        <div class="item item-3">3</div>
        <div class="item item-4">4</div>
        <div class="item item-5">5</div>
        <div class="item item-6">6</div>
        </div>
     <h2>What are CSS combinators?</h2>
     <p>Combinators combine the selectors to provide them a useful relationship and the
        position of content in the document. This comes in handy when you want to style
        certain elements all at once rather than styling elements individually. CSS
        combinator selectors are as follows.</p>
        <ol>
            <li> Descendant Selector (space)</li>
            <li>Child Selector (>)</li>
            <li>Adjacent Sibling Selector (+) </li>
            <li>General Sibling Selector (~)</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Descendant Selector :</h4><p>The descendant selector matches all elements that are
descendants of a specified element.</p>
<h4>Child Selector:</h4>
<p>The child selector will only affect elements under a direct
    parent. A good way to remember this is that a child will only listen to its direct
    parents.</p>
    <h4>Adjacent Sibling Selector:</h4>
    <p>To use the adjacent sibling selector in your CSS
        stylesheet, you simply need the plus (+) sign. The adjacent sibling selector is used
        to select an element that is directly after another specific element.</p>
        <h4>General Sibling Selector:</h4>
        <p>The general sibling selector follows through on all
            elements under the targeted HTML element selected. This means that if another
            element tag interrupts the direct adjacent flow, the style rules can still follow
            through.</p>

     <h2>What are pseudo selectors in CSS?</h2>
     <p>CSS pseudo-classes are used to add styles to selectors, but only when those
        selectors meet certain conditions. A pseudo class is expressed by adding a colon (:)
        after a selector in CSS, followed by a pseudo-class such as "hover", "focus", or
        "active".</p>
        <h4>Syntax:
            selector:pseudo-class {
            property : value;
            }
            </h4>
            <p>Some Examples of Pseudo-Class:</p>
            <ul>
          <li>:active It is used to add style to an active element.
            <li>:hover It adds special effects to an element when the user moves the
mouse pointer over the element.
<li><h4>:link</h4>- It adds style to the unvisited link.</li>
 <li><h4>:visited</h4> -It adds style to a visited link.</li>
<li><h4>:lang</h4>- It is used to define a language to use in a specified element.</li>
<li><h4>:focus</h4>- It selects the element which is focused by the user currently.</li>
<li><h4>:first-child</h4> -It adds special effects to an element, which is the first child of
another element.</li>
